1, the gdk is the database storage kernel of monetdb: www.monetdb.org/Home.
   And you must make first, then get the executive file. it's easy to 
   abstract it from the monetdb system. But it's hard to understand it well,
   monetdb is a pretty good in-memory database.

2, you maybe install pcre lib
   you maybe install other libs, unless you will meet with "undefined 
   reference to" error or you can see whether these libs have already been 
   installed in your machine! such as: bz2 curl xml2 pcre numa or something 
   else.

3, in the monetdb_gdk, there are some naive functions invoke tests, and a 
   simple numa load code which is named GDKNUMAload. you can invoke the 
   functions in the gdk, and implement some function in the in-memory 
   database.
  
4, I am sorry about that I don't make a tidy.

5, if you have some tips and advance, I am so wish that you can have a discuss
   with me about gdk or monetdb, please email to egraldlo@gmail.com, we 
   can learn monetdb together.
