1, the gdk is the database storage kernel of cwi:monetdb: www.monetdb.org.
   And you must make first, then get the executive file. it's easy to 
   abstract it from the monetdb system. But it's hard to understand it well,
   monetdb is a pretty good in-memory database.

2, you maybe install pcre&pcre-devel lib unless you will meet with "undefined 
   reference to" error or you can see whether these libs have already been 
   installed in your machine! such as: bz2 curl xml2 pcre numa or something 
   else.

3, in the main function, there are some naive functions invoke tests, and a 
   simple numa load code which is named GDKNUMAload. you can invoke the 
   functions in the gdk, and implement some function in the in-memory 
   database.
  
4, I am sorry about that I don't make a tidy.

5, if you have some tips and advance, I am so wish that you can have a discuss
   with me about gdk or monetdb, please email to zhangleicasa@gmail.com, we 
   can learn monetdb together.
